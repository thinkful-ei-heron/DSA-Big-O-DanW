1. 1) Constant

   2) Linear

2. Constant -- Peforms constant boolean evaluation on an integer

3. Polynomial -- Determines what elements match between two arrays, requiring 
                 linear search through second array for each value in first array
                 so n * n (assuming two arrays of equal length)

4. Linear -- Performs a constant expression for each of n elements in array

5. Linear -- Performs a constant boolean check for each of n elements in array

6. Polynomial -- Performs linear number of operations for each of n elements in array

7. Linear -- The algorithms inserts set of numbers set(x) into the xth indexes of an array,
              i.e. it creates the set of natural numbers from 0 to the given number ordered
              from 0.

8. Linear -- Searches array in reverse order, returning false if number being searched for is larger
            than biggest element in array.  In worst case, searching for smallest number in array, it 
            will still have to check n elements.

9. Constant -- Just returns a single index from array.

10. Linear -- First checks that number is bigger than one and is an integer.  It then iterates through set of integers
              from 2 up checking if number is divisible by that integer.  aka it is checking if number is prime.  In
              worst case (in which number is prime) it will have to do n operations.

13 & 14.  All algorithms are linear
